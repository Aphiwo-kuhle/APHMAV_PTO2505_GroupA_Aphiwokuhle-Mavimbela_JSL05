#🎯 README – JSL05 Task Board with Local Storage
📌 Project Title
🗂️ Task Board Application with Local Storage Persistence
📝 Project Description

This project is a fully functional Task Management Board built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. All tasks are saved in the browser’s localStorage 💾, so they remain available even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser.
